ExtJS User Extensions
--------------------

A collection of extensions for the excellent rich internet application library
ExtJS (http://www.sencha.com/).
These are extensions that I have found
in the forums and that I have used in previous projects.  The idea is to have
a centralized and controlled repository to host these extensions.
I am NOT the author of these extensions, I have just compiled them here and
sometimes modified them in order to suit my needs.  I also clean up the code
with the help of JSLint.
